        <!-- Your about content here -->
        Hi, I'm Jaweria Qaiser (Ja-where-ya Kai-zer)—a social psychology researcher and science communicator. I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto (Canada), where I study prosocial emotions (like empathy and compassion), interpersonal relationships (strangers, friends, couples), and morality both emotionally and physiologically. My research uses psychophysiological methods to ask foundational questions about human connection. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <strong> Is compassion a finite resource? </strong>
        </li>
        While dominant narratives suggest that repeated exposure to suffering leads to emotional exhaustion and declining compassion, my research challenges this view. Compassion may remain stable or even increase over time, while what actually declines is our emotional bandwidth and perceived ability to cope—leading to what we call “compassion fatigue.” This distinction invites a reconceptualization of how we measure and support compassionate engagement.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <strong> How do our bodies respond when we feel compassion or empathy across different affective contexts? </strong>
        </li>
        I explore whether physiological synchrony (Qaiser et al., 2023)—such as changes in heart rate or skin conductance—emerges during empathic exchanges, and how these responses vary depending on the emotional tone of the interaction (e.g., suffering vs. joy). These investigations help illuminate the embodied nature of empathy and the subtle ways our bodies attune to others, even when verbal communication is absent or limited.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <strong> How do we respond to others when we hold opposing moral values to them?  </strong>
        </li>
        This question probes the intersection of empathy and moral conflict. I’m interested in whether people can still engage empathically with those whose values they reject, and what psychological mechanisms either facilitate or inhibit that process. This line of inquiry has implications for polarization, dialogue, and the emotional labor of bridging ideological divides.
      </ul>
      <p>
        I take a basic science approach to these questions, but I'm equally drawn to their applied implications—how we teach empathy, how we support care-givers, and how we build more compassionate communities. My work has been published in Affective Science, recognizied through natioanl awards, and presented at leading conferences. I've also received accolades for translating my research into accessible formats, including public talks, creative media, and interdisciplinary workshops. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As an educator, I approach teaching as a relational and transformative practice. I've taught and mentored students across a range of psychology courses, and my pedagogy centres on inclusive, experiential, and student-driven learning. I am working toward securing advanced teaching certifications. I have experience teaching workshops on data science and psychophysiology at the high-school and undergradutate levels both nationally and internationally. I have also guest-lectured on the topic of Psychophysiology at the undergraduate-level. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the lab and classroom, I'm passionate about turning research into art. My creative portfolio includes visual storytelling and multimedia prohects that make psychological science feel personal and alive. Whether I'm menotring students, collaborating with fellow researchers, or engaging the public, I believe knowledge should be shared, felt, and co-created.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I am deeply committed to open science and making research and educational resources widely accessible. I contributed to an open access textbook on animal physiology and am grateful to be acknowledged for this work <a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/introanimalphysiology2nded/front-matter/thank-you/">here</a>. Sharing knowledge openly helps bridge the gap between science and the public, and aligns with my goal of fostering accessible, evidence-based learning.
      </p>
