          (pronounced <i>Ja-where-ya</i>) â€” a social psychology researcher and science communicator. I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto (Canada), where I study prosocial emotions (like empathy and compassion), interpersonal relationships (strangers, friends, couples), and morality both emotionally and physiologically. My research uses psychophysiological methods to ask foundational questions about human connection.

        <h3>Compassion for Individuals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How does compassion unfold?</li>
          <li>Compassion can remain stableâ€”or even growâ€”when we witness suffering.</li>
          <li>Preliminary research shows that what declines isnâ€™t compassion, but our ability to cope with the distress.</li>
          <li>Understanding this helps us sustain compassion and prevent out.</li>

        <h3>Compassion for Groups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How do our bodies attune to others?</li>
          <li>In dyads, physiological synchrony like heart rate changes can signal empathy (Qaiser et al., 2023).</li>
          <li>In groups, we explore empathic accuracy: can we accurately perceive collective emotions, and what drives it?</li>

        <h3>Responding across Moral Divide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can we empathize with those we disagree with?</li>
          <li>People can empathize even when values clashâ€”but psychological factors shape success.</li>
          <li>This research sheds light on polarization, dialogue, and the emotional effort of bridging divides.</li>

  <main>    
      <p>
        I take a basic science approach to these questions, but I'm equally drawn to their applied implicationsâ€”how we teach empathy, how we support care-givers, and how we build more compassionate communities. My work has been published in Affective Science, recognizied through natioanl awards, and presented at leading conferences. I've also received accolades for translating my research into accessible formats, including public talks, creative media, and interdisciplinary workshops. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As an educator, I approach teaching as a relational and transformative practice. I've taught and mentored students across a range of psychology courses, and my pedagogy centres on inclusive, experiential, and student-driven learning. I am working toward securing advanced teaching certifications. I have experience teaching workshops on data science and psychophysiology at the high-school and undergradutate levels both nationally and internationally. I have also guest-lectured on the topic of Psychophysiology at the undergraduate-level. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the lab and classroom, I'm passionate about turning research into art. My creative portfolio includes visual storytelling and multimedia prohects that make psychological science feel personal and alive. Whether I'm menotring students, collaborating with fellow researchers, or engaging the public, I believe knowledge should be shared, felt, and co-created.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I am deeply committed to open science and making research and educational resources widely accessible. I contributed to an open access textbook on animal physiology and am grateful to be acknowledged for this work <a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/introanimalphysiology2nded/front-matter/thank-you/">here</a>. Sharing knowledge openly helps bridge the gap between science and the public, and aligns with my goal of fostering accessible, evidence-based learning.
